Generates FPGA code to solve Variational circuits

Running the code will generate Verilog that can be directly compiled to be run on an FPGA.  I have only tested this compilation using Quartus for an Altera Cyclone V FPGA.  

A thorough write-up of all the derivations of quantum circuits and formulas will be published in my Masters thesis upon acceptance.  Research is done in collaboration with Dr Calvin Johnson.
